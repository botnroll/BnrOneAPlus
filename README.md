## Examples
Here is a quick example to get you started:

```cpp
#include <BnrOneAPlus.h>   // Bot'n Roll ONE A+ library
#include <SPI.h>       // SPI communication library required by BnrOneAPlus.cpp
BnrOneAPlus one;           // declaration of object variable

#define SSPIN  2       // Slave Select (SS) pin for SPI communication

void setup() 
{
    Serial.begin(115200);     // set baud rate to 115200bps for printing values
    one.spiConnect(SSPIN);   // start SPI communication module
    one.stop();              // stop motors
}

void loop()
{
    one.lcd2("    Forward "); // print data on LCD line 2
    one.move(50,50);          // Forward
    delay(1000);              // wait 1 second
    one.lcd2("     Stop   ");
    one.stop();               // Stop Motors
    delay(500);
    one.lcd2("   Backwards ");
    one.move(-50,-50);        // Backwards
    delay(1000);
    one.lcd2("     Stop   ");
    one.move(0,0);            // Stop Motors
    delay(500);
}
```
